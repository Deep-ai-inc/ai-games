# The Big Picture

### As of 2022-2023, Generative AI learns from vast quantities of unlabeled human data.
### The AI learns from this data to produce human-like outputs.

This works for nearly any type of content, including:
text/dialogue, images, video, audio, and more.

# How Text-To-Image Models Work

We need a training dataset of millions of image and caption pairs.

This is the only data needed to train the model to generate images from text.

---

**Image Encoder**: Translates training images to vectors in a latent space for further processing. The latent space is a mathematical space where the image information can be represented as vectors (i.e. arrays of numbers)

**Text Encoder**: Translates text into high dimensional vectors (you can think of them as arrays of numbers that represent the meaning of the texts) that machine learning models can understand.

**Diffusion model**: Generates new images in the latent space, conditioned by the text guidance (i.e. the input text guides the generation of images in this latent space)

**Image Decoder**: Translates the image information in the latent space to an actual image constructed with pixels.

# CLIP text and image embeddings


CLIP maps images and text into a shared latent space where the similarity of the representations indicates similarity of the content.

# Large Language Models

<img src="images/language model decoder.png" width="70%"><br/>
Large language models are complex deep learning functions that map a context of input text tokens to output a probability distribution of the next token in the sequence.

This probability distribution can be decoded into a text token, which can then be appended to the input context to generate a longer sequence.

# OpenAI Language Models

### Currently, OpenAI's text (language) models are the most advanced.

OpenAI offers many different models. The most important are:

GPT3.5

GPT3.5-turbo (default model of ChatGPT)

GPT4

---

## GPT3.5-turbo is fast and cheap and very capable

It's the default model of ChatGPT

## GPT4 is newer and smarter

It's more expensive

It's slower

It's far smarter and more capable.

It has advanced reasoning and programming capabilities!

I sometimes call it "basically a brain"

---

# Both GPT3.5 and GPT4 are available via OpenAI API

This allows you to easily build their capabilities into your own app.

The API requests are JSON and output JSON.

---

# The API supports "streaming" mode

This allows you to show the output as it is generated.

It is a little more complex call the API in streaming mode, but not super hard.

They use something called "Server Sent Events" for streaming

---

# API calls take in chat history:


## 3 types of messages:

### system prompt
### user messages
### assistant messages

## Then the API outputs one assistant response

---

# Other API parameters:

## Temperature
* Controls the amount of randomness/creativity in the response

* Value between 0 and 2 (show temperature demo)

## max_tokens - limits the size of outputs

---

# OpenAI Pricing

Model	Prompt	Completion
GPT4-8K context	$0.03 / 1K tokens	$0.06 / 1K tokens

Model	Usage
gpt-3.5-turbo	$0.002 / 1K tokens

---

# Let's build a game

We'll use both image and text generation to build a role playing game.

### Prompt engineering

    write 1-sentence bio's of 5 random characters in a role-playing game.
    the characters should have a name.
    respond as a JSON array with keys "name", "bio".
